Significant hx - fall in garage January 2021 - small left vertex intracranial hemorrhage/ contusion. Symptoms of numbness to left side of face resolved. Reporting occasional headache temporal areas. No visual changes, specifically no diplopia. No nv. No muscle weakness, numbness or tingling.   O/ Alert and oriented to person, place, time, season. Looks well. Good eye contact. Normal rate of speech and fluency at this time. Thoughts seem organized, but reporting can  \"lose track\" of what she is talking about. No echolalia noted today. Skin warm dry, cr N.  BP 138/79. HR RRR 76. RR 16 even. Forgot to get her wt - fu next appt.  CN 2-12 tested intact. Neg romberg. Neg drift. DTR 1+ patellar/ankle, DTR 2 bicep/tricep - symmetrical.  PERRL. EOM N. PERRL. OP N. No lesions. No tongue deviation. MMM. Facial symmetry present. Sensory not tested today although reports no numbness, tingling or paresthesias - did have after fall - resolved after 2 weeks.

Unable to place hands correctly - pointing at the 11 position only. Asked to display time - set hands to 10 past 11.  Word recall - 2/3 Clock 0/2.  Total score 2/5 mini-cog.  Plan 1. ECG 2. Echocardiogram 3. Screening labs - req given.  4. Consult neurology ? ABI vs MCI vs early dementia.  5. Consider referral to Memory Clinic.  6. Fu need for further imaging after consulting with neurology  ? repeat CT scan vs MRI.  Discussed above with Dorothy and will fu in the next 2 weeks.   Question - I am considering ABI vs MCI / early dementia. She reported feeling well prior to fall therefore considering ABI - although significant stressor - COVID19 isolation, death of husband in LTC. Advise need for inperson assessment with neurology vs additional imaging - repeat CT vs MRI ?\\n31-Mar-2021 13:17 (Log Summary): (PCP Entry) eConsult created\\n31-Mar-2021 13:34 (Log Summary): (Assigner Entry) eConsult assigned\\n31-Mar-2021 13:42 (20Min Reason):\\n31-Mar-2021 13:42 (Log Summary): (Specialist Entry) Specialist requested referral: Yes i agree the question is ABI vs some form of dementia. There is a rare condition called Primary Progressive Aphasia that can present this way. It is one of the FTLD’s (fronto-temporal lobular degenerations) and, as such, there is often a strong family hx of dementia. The Bruyere memory disorder clinic is where she should be assessed and they will likely run in depth neuropsychological testing. An MRI will be helpful, as well as things like TSH, B12 etc\\n31-Mar-2021 13:42 (Log Summary): (Specialist Entry) Specialist requested referral reason: As above, memory disorder clinic for query primary progressive aphasia/FTLD\\n31-Mar-2021 16:34 (Log Summary): (PCP Entry) PCP Closed Request: PCP will make referral\\n'"

However, it is important to monitor the QTc interval closely due to the patient's frequent PVCs. I recommend starting Aricept and repeating an ECG one week after initiation to reassess the QTc of non-PVC beats. If the QTc remains within normal limits, you can continue the medication with periodic monitoring.

Even safer, which some people get benefit from and others don't, is trying melatonin (there is a theory with dementia that the hormones that tell you when to go to sleep and when to wake up are all out of whack). If neither of these work, using some of the anti-psychotics would be tricky as you have correctly identified his vascular history would make it more risky. HOWEVER, for context, he has a progressive and incurable illness with his dementia anyways, if we step back and aim for quality of life, then sometimes trialing of a low dose of seroquel might make sense in the bigger picture.

The only possible hope for it to improve would be if there is a correctable macrovascular lesion, and the patient/SDM agree to pursue revascularization. Even that is not a guarantee - in all likelihood a vascular surgery opinion (which you should absolutely pursue) will be that amputation is required. If this is not in the patient's goals of care, then the best you could achieve is to slow down the deterioration of the lesion, and to manage the significant pain that one would expect due to ischemia. For the latter, I presume you have already sought palliative care input. For the former, systemic antibiotics should be used sparingly, essentially to control rapid expansion, purulent discharge, and (arguable) flares in pain. For this, I suggest a short course of broad-spectrum therapy with anti-staph and anti-anaerobic coverage, and it should be oral (there is not enough potential benefit to justify the risks of IV therapy.)\")],\n",
