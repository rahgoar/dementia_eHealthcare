# 𝜉-Algorithm

The `𝜉-Algorithm` directory contains the implementation of our custom algorithm designed to enhance the accuracy of dementia prediction models.

## Overview

The 𝜉-Algorithm is a specialized machine learning algorithm developed to process and analyze textual data from eConsultations. It focuses on identifying linguistic patterns and markers indicative of early-stage dementia, providing interpretable results through integrated Explainable AI techniques.

## Contents

- `xi_algorithm.py`: Main script implementing the 𝜉-Algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions supporting data processing and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

To utilize the 𝜉-Algorithm:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the main repository's requirements.
2. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
3. Run `xi_algorithm.py` with the dataset as input.

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the comments within the scripts.
