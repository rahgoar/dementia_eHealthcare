# Explainable (XAI) Prediction of Dementia in e-Consult's Using Natural Language Processing

This repository hosts the project "Automatic Dementia Identification for eConsult Service Users using Explainable AI (XAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)." The primary objective is to develop models and tools that assist in the early detection of dementia through the analysis of electronic consultation data.

## Abstract

In this study, we present a novel approach to automatically identify potential dementia cases among eConsult service users. By leveraging Explainable AI and Natural Language Processing techniques, our models analyze textual data to detect early signs of cognitive decline. The integration of XAI ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and interpretable, facilitating trust and adoption in clinical settings.

## Repository Structure

- `ùúâ-Algorithm/`: Contains the implementation of the ùúâ-Algorithm, a core component of our predictive model.
- `chatbot/`: Includes the code and resources for the chatbot designed to interact with users and answer quesitons.
- `network_centrality.html`: Interactive knowledge graph highlighting central terms related to dementia.
- `network_confusion.html`: Knowledge graph depicting terms that often lead to model confusion.
- `network_topic_keywords.html`: Visualization of clustered topic terms pertinent to dementia.

## Knowledge Graphs

We provide three interactive knowledge graphs to enhance understanding:

1. **Centrality Graph**: Showcases pivotal terms in dementia-related discussions.
2. **Confusion Graph**: Highlights terms that the model finds challenging, leading to potential misclassifications.
3. **Topic-Terms Graph**: Displays clusters of terms associated with specific dementia topics.

*To interact with these graphs, download the HTML files and open them in a web browser.*
